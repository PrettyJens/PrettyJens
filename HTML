Elements 
- the smallest building blocks of the language 
- consist of opening tags, content and closing tags. 
Tags
- enclosed in angle brackets

Hello World - content
</p> - closing tag

<h1> = most important heading tags
<h6> = least important heading tags
<p> = paragraphs
<body> = body / any content we want to display

Indentation
- makes the code easier to read and visualise the nesting levels

<body>
   <p>Fire</p>
   <p>Water</p> 
   <p>Earth</p>
   <p>Air</p>
</body>

Headings
- there are 6 levels of headings from <h1> to <h6>

Line Break
<br> = break tag which adds a line break

A self closing tag doesn't need to be closed manually to closing tag, it does not have separate closing tag.
