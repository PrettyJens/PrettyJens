Learning HTML on Codedex

O1: Shooting Star
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) 
Developed by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991

Basic ex. Of HTML
A shooting Star is falling on the horizon, make a wish! 
Type the date today and your wish using html

01 Ex. 
<h2> April 6 2025 </h2>
<p> My wish is to learn more about programming and graduate :) </p>

02: Elemental

Elements 
- the smallest building blocks of the language 
- consist of opening tags, content and closing tags. 
Tags
- enclosed in angle brackets
Ex. <p>Hello World</p>
<p> - opening tag
Hello World - content
</p> - closing tag

<h1> = most important heading tags
<h6> = least important heading tags
<p> = paragraphs
<body> = body / any content we want to display

Indentation
- makes the code easier to read and visualise the nesting levels

02 Ex. 
<body>
   <p>Fireüî•</p>
   <p>Water üíß</p> 
   <p>Earth üåç</p>
   <p>Air </p>
</body>

03: Newspapers

Headings
- there are 6 levels of headings from <h1> to <h6>

Line Break
<br> = break tag which adds a line break

A self closing tag doesn't need to be closed manually to closing tag, it does not have separate closing tag. 

03 Ex. 
<body>
  <h1> The NewYork Times </h1>
  <h3> December 21 2004 </h3>
  <p>Classical Music Reviews: Interlocking Trios, a Bold Quartet, an Elite Pickup Group and a Choir for the ages</p>
  <p>Company News: Panamsat Plans $1.2 Billion Offering</p>
</body>

04: Corporate Talk
Text formatting 
<b> bold
<i> italicize

<s> strikethrough 

04 Ex. 
<p><b>Cutting Down, Ramping Up:</b> we have a robust strategy for <s>low hanging fruits </s>mission-critical objectives that move the needle at all cost. Its time to double down on <b>revenue growth</b> while <u>cutting cost. </u>This is a win-win initiative, a win for us and our amazing shareholders! </p>

Lists
- way to manage time, figure out what needs to be done and remember things. 

2 types of HTML Lists (<ul> and <ol>) 
<ul> = unordered list
- also known as bullet points, start with <ul> tag and wrap each item in a <li> list item element.
- good for listening things in any order. 

<ul> Ex. 
<ul>
  <li> Apple üçè </li>
<ul>

<ol> = ordered list
- also known as numbered list

<ol> Ex. 
<ol>
  <li> Apple üçè </li>
</ol>

05 Ex. 
<h1><b>Pasta with Bacon And Tomato Sauce</b></h1>
<body>

Links
- Links are integral to the idea of the internet. They are how users connect to other sites and navigate the web.

We can use the <a> anchor element! This link tag allows us to add a hyperlink to a piece of text.
- the <a> anchor element is similar to other tags, where the text inside is what is displayed.

An href, or hyperlink reference, is a reference or pointer to another website that is linked in our HTML. When the text ‚ÄúInternet Archive‚Äù is clicked, the HTML will redirect to that site
- This can also be used to point to an email or phone number using a mailto:, tel:, or sms: parameter. 

Ex. 
<a href="mailto:frankie@gmail.com">üìß</a>
<a href="tel:212-555-2368">ü§ô</a>
<a href="sms:320-250-HTML">üí¨</a>

Images
- <img>
- Src attribute, which stands for ‚Äúsource‚Äù, specifies the file path of the image.
https://i.redd.it/5unn16axx1v81.jpg is the image path.
- For most images, the file path can be found by right-clicking on the image and selecting ‚ÄúCopy Image Address‚Äù.

06 Ex. 
<html>
<title>pet.html</title>
<h1>Kitty</h1>
<body>
<img scr="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?">
<p>Kitty is a cute cat</p>
</body>
</html>

07. FAVOURITE BOND
chapter Practice
(Create a band.html page for your favorite artist using all the elements we learned and at least two types of text formatting.
It should include the following:

The name of the artist.
A picture of the artist or album cover.
A short blurb about the artist.
A link to the artist's website.
The members in an unordered list.
Top 5 favorite songs in an ordered list.
When it's done, take a screenshot and click the Twitter icon to post your band page! üé∏)

The <!DOCTYPE html> is the document type declaration that appears at the top of a .html file and tells the browser that our file is written in HTML5. This is used with a <html> element containing all the code processed on the page.

We skipped them in the first chapter, but all HTML files must start with a <!DOCTYPE html> declaration and the <html> element:
 
<!DOCTYPE html> doesn‚Äôt have a closing tag, while <html> does.

Inside <html>, there should be two elements:

<head> contains all the info for your browser that's not visible on the page.
<body> contains all of the content that you will end up seeing on the page.

The <title> element goes in the <head> and assigns text to the browser tab.

09: Family Tree

Most individual elements can be parents with one or more child elements. 

Here are some relationships:

<head> and <body> are children of <html>.
<title> is the child of <head>.
<i> is child of <p> and grandchild of <body>.

Elements can also be siblings if they share a direct parent element. Take this unordered list, 

The two <li> elements are siblings because both are children of the same parent, the <ul> element.

10: comments
Comments are useful for taking notes about the logic and intentions behind different parts of our web page. They help us understand what our code is doing, especially if it was written a while ago.

Not only should comments benefit whoever wrote the code, but they should also be helpful to anyone reviewing it later. 
Ex. 
<! -- this is a comment - - >

# Attributes
Attributes are additional settings that we can use to customize an element.

They are usually name/value pairs, like name="value", where the name and value are separated by an equals sign:

<element name="value">Content</element>

The name indicates the attribute we are setting for our element.
The "value" for our attribute is surrounded by " double quotes.

Lowercase <ol type="a">
Roman Numerals <ol type = "i" >

The <img> element uses the src attribute to specify the file path of an image.

And remember that width="250" attribute from the previous exercise? Yup! That was an attribute that sets the width of the image.

In addition to src, we can also use the alt attribute to make our images more accessible.

The href attribute is where we add a URL that can be visited when the hyperlinked text is clicked.

We can also use the target attribute and set it to "_blank" to make the link open in a new browser tab:

# Classes and IDs
The two attributes we'll come across most are the class and id attributes. Any element can use them. While class and id are used for labeling elements, the two have important differences.

An element can be assigned multiple class values in the form of a space-separated list:

<p class="first-value second-value third-value">Hello, World</p>

Each element can only have one id value with no spaces. Every id value should be unique in the entire page:

<p id="value">Hello, World</p>

id can be used to link to another part of the same page, such as the heading! This can be matched with an <a> anchor element's href attribute via a # hashtag symbol, followed by the identifier used for the id:

<a href="#medellin">Link to Medell√≠n</a>

<h2 class="city" id="medellin">Medell√≠n üá®üá¥</h2>

only one id can be assigned to a single element, a class can be assigned to many:

<h2 class="city" id="medellin">Medell√≠n üá®üá¥</h2>
<h2 class="city" id="lisbon">Lisbon üáµüáπ</h2>
<h2 class="city" id="bali">Bali üáÆüá©</h2>

The values for the class and id attributes must always be lowercase. If their name is made of multiple words, they should be separated by dashes -.

# Division Element
One of the most common ways of creating sections for a page is with the <div> element (short for "division").

The <div> element is kind of like a generic container with no particular meaning. This element and the class and id attributes can go hand in hand. 

The <div> element is used to group content and be labeled by the class and id attributes.

13: The style attributes

First, we can apply a style attribute to any HTML element to stylize certain aspects of that element, such as what color the text should be:

<p>
  Roses are <span style="color:red;">red</span>.<br />
  Violets are <span style="color:blue;">blue</span>.
</p>

This attribute uses a special syntax where a style is made of a property (i.e., color) and a value (red), separated by a : colon. Multiple styles can be applied to a single element, but they must be separated by a ; semi-colon. 
The color property sets the color for the text of an element.
The text-decoration adds text formatting (such as underline), similar to what the <b>, <i>, <u>, and <s> elements do.

Style Element
the <style> element can be used in the <head> to style our elements in the <body>. 
Elements can be selected inside the <style> element using { } curly braces:
Inside the <style> element, you can use a period . (class) or hashtag # (id) to select one or more specific elements that have a matching class or id, respectively:

Ex. 
<! DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>power-rangers.html</title>
    <style>
      .ranger-div{
      width:50%;
      height:100px; 
     }
#red-ranger{
      background-color:red;
     } 
#blue-ranger{
      background-color:blue;
     } 
#black-ranger{
      background-color:black;
     } 
#yellow-ranger{
      background-color:yellow;
     } 
#pink-ranger{
      background-color:pink;
     } 
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
      <div class="ranger-div" id="red-ranger"></div>
      <div class="ranger-div" id="blue-ranger"></div>
      <div class="ranger-div" id="black-ranger"></div>
      <div class="ranger-div" id="yellow-ranger"></div>
      <div class="ranger-div" id="pink-ranger"></div>
  </body>
</html>
