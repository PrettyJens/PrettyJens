Elements 
- the smallest building blocks of the language 
- consist of opening tags, content and closing tags. 
Tags
- enclosed in angle brackets
Ex. <p>Hello World</p>
<p> - opening tag
Hello World - content
</p> - closing tag

<h1> = most important heading tags
<h6> = least important heading tags
<p> = paragraphs
<body> = body / any content we want to display

Indentation
- makes the code easier to read and visualise the nesting levels
Ex. 
<body>
   <p>Fire</p>
   <p>Water</p> 
   <p>Earth</p>
   <p>Air</p>
</body>
