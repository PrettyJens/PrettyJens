O1: Shooting Star
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) 
Developed by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991

Basic ex. Of HTML
A shooting Star is falling on the horizon, make a wish! 
Type the date today and your wish using html

01 Ex. 
<h2> April 6 2025 </h2>
<p> My wish is to learn more about programming and graduate :) </p>

02: Elemental

Elements 
- the smallest building blocks of the language 
- consist of opening tags, content and closing tags. 
Tags
- enclosed in angle brackets
Ex. <p>Hello World</p>
<p> - opening tag
Hello World - content
</p> - closing tag

<h1> = most important heading tags
<h6> = least important heading tags
<p> = paragraphs
<body> = body / any content we want to display

Indentation
- makes the code easier to read and visualise the nesting levels

02 Ex. 
<body>
   <p>Fireüî•</p>
   <p>Water üíß</p> 
   <p>Earth üåç</p>
   <p>Air </p>
</body>

03: Newspapers

Headings
- there are 6 levels of headings from <h1> to <h6>

Line Break
<br> = break tag which adds a line break

A self closing tag doesn't need to be closed manually to closing tag, it does not have separate closing tag. 

03 Ex. 
<body>
  <h1> The NewYork Times </h1>
  <h3> December 21 2004 </h3>
  <p>Classical Music Reviews: Interlocking Trios, a Bold Quartet, an Elite Pickup Group and a Choir for the ages</p>

Lists
- way to manage time, figure out what needs to be done and remember things. 

2 types of HTML Lists (<ul> and <ol>) 
<ul> = unordered list
- also known as bullet points, start with <ul> tag and wrap each item in a <li> list item element.
- good for listening things in any order. 

<ul> Ex. 
<ul>
  <li> Apple üçè </li>
<ul>

<ol> = ordered list
- also known as numbered list

<ol> Ex. 
<ol>
  <li> Apple üçè </li>
</ol>

Links
- Links are integral to the idea of the internet. They are how users connect to other sites and navigate the web.

We can use the <a> anchor element! This link tag allows us to add a hyperlink to a piece of text.
- the <a> anchor element is similar to other tags, where the text inside is what is displayed.

An href, or hyperlink reference, is a reference or pointer to another website that is linked in our HTML. When the text ‚ÄúInternet Archive‚Äù is clicked, the HTML will redirect to that site
- This can also be used to point to an email or phone number using a mailto:, tel:, or sms: parameter. 

Ex. 
<a href="mailto:frankie@gmail.com">üìß</a>
<a href="tel:212-555-2368">ü§ô</a>
<a href="sms:320-250-HTML">üí¨</a>

Images
- <img>
- Src attribute, which stands for ‚Äúsource‚Äù, specifies the file path of the image.
https://i.redd.it/5unn16axx1v81.jpg is the image path.
- For most images, the file path can be found by right-clicking on the image and selecting ‚ÄúCopy Image Address‚Äù.

06 Ex. 
<html>
<title>pet.html</title>
<h1>Kitty</h1>
<body>
<img scr="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?">
<p>Kitty is a cute cat</p>
</body>
</html>

07. FAVOURITE BOND
chapter Practice
(Create a band.html page for your favorite artist using all the elements we learned and at least two types of text formatting.
It should include the following:

The name of the artist.
A picture of the artist or album cover.
A short blurb about the artist.
A link to the artist's website.
The members in an unordered list.
Top 5 favorite songs in an ordered list.
When it's done, take a screenshot and click the Twitter icon to post your band page! üé∏) 

08: Blue Print 

The <!DOCTYPE html> is the document type declaration that appears at the top of a .html file and tells the browser that our file is written in HTML5. This is used with a <html> element containing all the code processed on the page.

We skipped them in the first chapter, but all HTML files must start with a <!DOCTYPE html> declaration and the <html> element:
 
<!DOCTYPE html> doesn‚Äôt have a closing tag, while <html> does.

Inside <html>, there should be two elements:

<head> contains all the info for your browser that's not visible on the page.
<body> contains all of the content that you will end up seeing on the page.

The <title> element goes in the <head> and assigns text to the browser tab.

09: Family Tree

Most individual elements can be parents with one or more child elements. 

Here are some relationships:

<head> and <body> are children of <html>.
<title> is the child of <head>.
<i> is child of <p> and grandchild of <body>.

Elements can also be siblings if they share a direct parent element. Take this unordered list, 

The two <li> elements are siblings because both are children of the same parent, the <ul> element.

10: comments
Comments are useful for taking notes about the logic and intentions behind different parts of our web page. They help us understand what our code is doing, especially if it was written a while ago.

Not only should comments benefit whoever wrote the code, but they should also be helpful to anyone reviewing it later. 
Ex. 
<! -- this is a comment - - >
